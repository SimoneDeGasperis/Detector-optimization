# Detector-optimization
The project is the last assignement in the course Addressing Large Hadron Collider Challenges by Machine Learning by HSE University on Coursera.
It explains how to design a simple tracking system using Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes. 
Although the project was designed for the ATLAS tracking system experiment at CERN it can also be generalized to other projects.
The repository contains:

- the main notebook tracker.ipynb
- some utility functions defined in utils.py
- a repository pic containing images used in the project
